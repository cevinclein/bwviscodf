# 1. Overview

bwVisu is quite simple and intuitively designed to make launching apps on the cluster as user-friendly as possible. Once you have successfully logged into bwVisu, the first thing you see is the dashboard. The dashboard presents a selection of available apps that the user can launch.

In the navigation bar, the user has the following options:

- **Files:** Here, the user has access to their home directory. In a graphical user interface, files can be downloaded and uploaded, and new files and folders can be created.
- **Interactive apps:** This displays the apps that the user can run on the cluster, possibly across multiple nodes. These apps initiate an interactive session which the user can directly connect to and, depending on the app, receive a graphical interface.
- **All Apps**: This shows all available apps.
- **My Interactive Sessions**: At bwVisu, it is possible to start several interactive apps simultaneously. Here, one can view an overview of currently running interactive apps or even completed sessions. It is also possible to view the log for each session.
  
# 2. Files

If you click on the file menu, you will get two options:

- Home Directory
- OOD Config

The most relevant is access to the Home Directory because that's where results and logs from the apps are stored.
The user gets the following interface:

The user interface is largely self-explanatory. However, an important note is that one can only access corners and 
files if they have the appropriate rights.
